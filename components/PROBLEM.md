# There is a problem in this code. Give me a list of the bugs you find.


-- Missing return type for async functions: All the async functions should have a return type of `Promise<void>` or `Promise<any[]>` as per their usage. For example, createCourseEntry, updateCourseEntry, deleteCourseEntry, getAllCourseEntries, createYearEntry, updateYearEntry, deleteYearEntry, getAllYearEntries are missing their return types.

-- Inconsistent use of semicolons: There are some inconsistencies in the use of semicolons. For example, in the createCourseEntry function, there is no semicolon at the end of the try block, but there is one at the end of the catch block.

-- Unused variables: In the ensureTableExists function, the db variable is declared but never used. Instead, openDatabaseConnection() is called directly in the transaction.

-- Potential SQL injection vulnerability: In the dropTable and deleteAllEntries functions, the table name is directly concatenated into the SQL query, which could lead to SQL injection attacks if the table name is not properly sanitized.

-- Missing error handling in promise rejections: In several places, errors are caught and logged, but the promise is rejected without passing the error. This could make it difficult to handle errors properly in the calling code. For example, in the getAllCourseEntries function, the reject(error) call should be inside the catch block.

-- Inconsistent error handling in transaction callbacks: In some places, the transaction callback functions return false when an error occurs, while in others, they do not. This could lead to inconsistent behavior when handling errors.

-- Missing await in ensureTableExists: In the ensureTableExists function, the openDatabaseConnection() call is not awaited, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

-- Potential race condition in ensureTableExists: The ensureTableExists function checks if a table exists and creates it if it doesn't. However, if two calls to this function are made concurrently for the same table, it could lead to a race condition where the table is created twice.

-- Missing error handling in openDatabaseConnection: The openDatabaseConnection function is called in several places, but there is no error handling for the case where the database connection fails.

-- Missing error handling in ensureCourseTableExists and ensureYearTableExists: These functions call executeSql without handling errors. If an error occurs, it will be silently ignored.

-- Missing error handling in createCourseEntry, updateCourseEntry, deleteCourseEntry, createYearEntry, updateYearEntry, and deleteYearEntry: These functions call executeSql without handling errors. If an error occurs, it will be silently ignored.

-- Missing error handling in getAllCourseEntries and getAllYearEntries: These functions call executeSql without handling errors. If an error occurs, it will be silently ignored.

-- Missing error handling in dropTable and deleteAllEntries: These functions call executeSql without handling errors. If an error occurs, it will be silently ignored.

-- Missing error handling in deleteDatabase: This function calls deleteDatabaseAsync without handling errors. If an error occurs, it will be silently ignored.

-- Inconsistent error messages: In some places, the error message is generated using e.message, while in others, it is hard-coded. This could lead to inconsistencies in error reporting.

Overall, there are a few issues with inconsistent coding style and missing error handling, which could make the code harder to understand and maintain. Additionally, there are a few potential security issues related to SQL injection and missing error handling. It is recommended to fix these issues to ensure the code is robust and secure.
